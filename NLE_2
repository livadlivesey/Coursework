        "(a) Path similarity is measured on a scale of 0-1, and denotes the shortest path that connects the two senses. So the score of 0.083, is very low and indicates that the senses are not similar. Resnik similarity is measured on a scale of 0 to infinity, and returns the information content of the lowest common subsumer of the two concepts. We can also see that 1.29 is a low score and further suggests that the senses do not share meaning. Lin similarity uses the same measures as Resnik, but converts the score to a ratio out of 1. Therefore, 0.15 is a little higher compared to the other similarity scores and suggests some relation between the senses. All 3 scores are relatively low, but show that there is some relation between 'house' and 'garden' but not that they mean similar things. For example, the senses may be connected in a taxonomy, such as both the words relate to the grounds of a building, or property. This is demonstrated by the above definitions. "

For the semantic similarity, I will use the Path Similarity measure for consistency, as this is the measure I used earlier in the notebook. I will also compare the Semantic and Distributional similarity over a range of Window Sizes and present these results. Specifically, I will use the Window Sizes: 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9. Finally I will present the Spearman's rank Correlation for the data over different window sizes in a table for easy analysis. From this data and comparisons, I will try to conclude which window size for distributional similarity best approximates semantic similarity. I will also try to answer the question, does semantic similarity correlate with distributional similarity, over a range of context window sizes.\n",

The distributional similarity for the same pair of words is much lower, at 0.12 to 0.10 over the different window sizes. \n",
        "Through this investigation, we can see that as the context window size increases, the distributional similarity score for a word pair also increases. Given the correlations calculated for each window size, we can see that a window size of 5 for distributional similarity gives the best approximation of semantic similarity, as this is the highest correlation of 0.457. The correlation between Semantic and Distributional Similarity levels off around   0.45 from a window size of 5 to 9. From this Spearman's Rank correlation coefficient, we can interpret that there is a moderate positive correlation/relationship between Semantic and Distributional Similarity, over a range of pairs of words.
